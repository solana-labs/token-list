    "description": "When humans were racing to expand into outer space under Ahr’s influence, the devastation they inflicted upon the planet was so great that it weakened the Earth’s geomagnetic field. The reckless way the planet’s orbit was populated by machines and debris led to distortions in the gravity field. All this culminated in a disastrous slingshot effect for the many satellites orbiting the blue dot, altering their trajectories to loosen the direct gravity pull of the planet and scatter into deep space. Some of these satellites contained valuable data that was lost forever.  In 2621, the Council of Peace put a bounty on these ancient artifacts to integrate them into Star Atlas, leading to a hunt for them across the galaxy. One of the most sought-after satellites in history records bears the name of Neil Armstrong, the first human to set foot on the Moon.  Initially launched into medium Earth orbit as a cornerstone of the global positioning system (GPS), the satellite had untold additional capabilities that made it more and more valuable as it drifted off into the void.",
